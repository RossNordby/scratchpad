        //We need a per-body list of constraints because any movement of a body requires updating the connected constraints.
        //Since we have that, we'll also use it to find adjacent bodies. Finding adjacent bodies is required for two purposes:
        //1) Deactivating an island of low energy bodies.
        //2) Optimizing the memory layout of bodies so that connected bodies tend to be adjacent or at least nearby.

        //Conceptually, we could do something simple like a List<List<int>> for a per-body list of constraint handles.
        //An obvious optimization to that is to pool the internal lists to avoid GC overhead, but there is another factor to consider beyond just garbage generation-
        //heap complexity.

        //The goal here is to reduce the cost of a GC. While the engine should never produce garbage itself during regular execution, the application using it might.
        //The cost of a GC is partially related to the number of references it has to track down. An array of reference types requires examining every one of those references.
        //So, if you have 16384 bodies with lists stored in List<int>[] representation, the GC has at least 32768 references it needs to consider (the list, and its internal array)!
        //In contrast, if you pack the representation into a single int[] with the lists suballocated from it, the GC doesn't need to scan it- ints aren't reference types.

        //QuickLists based on a pointer-backed Buffer<int> contain no references at all, so QuickList<int, Buffer<int>>[] only costs a single reference- for the top level array.
