        //TODO: 
        //There are a some issues inherited from the prototype that we'd like to address at some point:
        //1) Recursion. There's no reason to use recursion here.
        //2) Duplicate work with the single threaded variant. The current load balancing approach uses a single threaded pass to dive into the tree, and that logic
        //is basically identical. It would be great to have a zero overhead abstraction that unifies the two. Unclear how useful this is- it's possible that the abstraction
        //would end up being more complex than just two near-identical implementations.
        //3) Limited workstealing capacity. While we can dive arbitrarily far in the first pass, it increases the single threaded phase.
        //If the narrow phase relies on the broadphase for its work balancing (that is, the overlap handler directly triggers narrow phase work), 
        //you may need to dive so deeply to maintain load balance that the single threaded phase starts to limit parallelism meaningfully. 
        //Any constant cost less than ~5us is basically irrelevant, though- if you can collect 128 nodepairs to test in 5us, that would likely be enough to load balance the narrow phase
        //even on something like 16 cores. 
        //4) If the handler directly executes narrow phase work, overlaps handled during the single threaded collection phase could be nasty. This should be pretty rare for any nontrivial
        //tree, but it's still something to be aware of in corner cases.

        //To specifically address #3 above, consider explicit workstealing. When a worker is out of directly accessible work (its exhausted its own stack, and no more precollected roots exist),
        //it could snoop other worker stacks. This would introduce sync requirements on every stack. 
        //1) The stealer would probably start at claim 0 and walk forward. The largest jobs are at the top of the stack, which gives you the most bang for the sync work buck.
        //It would check the claims state of each stack entry- there would be a integer on each entry marking it as claimed or not. Once a candidate is found, compare exchange to claim it.
        //It would have to distinguish between 'stolen' blocks and locally claimed blocks. A thief can step over stolen blocks, but if it hits a locally claimed block, it has to stop.
        //2) While pushing new jobs to the local stack is free, victims must always check to confirm that a stack pop will not consume a job that has been stolen by another thread.
        //Given that shallow stack accesses will tend to be less work, the local thread should probably prefer claiming chunks of its stack at a time. It can do this simply by 
        //performing a compare exchange on a stack element the desired number of elements up the stack. Since thieves always work step by step without leaving any gaps, the local thread
        //can block them by claiming at any (unclaimed) point in the stack. All later stack entries can be unaffected. In practice, this means local threads should be able to 
        //avoid doing interlocked operations on the overwhelming majority of pop operations.

        //With such a scheme, you would still want to somehow collect an initial set of jobs to give workers something to munch on, but you don't need lots of jobs per worker anymore.
        //So, if you had a 128 core machine, you could get away with still having ~256 jobs- which you can probably collect in less than 20us even on lower frequency processors 
        //(like the ones you'd find in a 128 core machine).
