    {
        //We want to keep removes as fast as possible. So, when removing constraints, no attempt is made to pull constraints from higher constraint batches into the revealed slot.
        //Over time, this could result in lots of extra constraint batches that ruin multithreading performance.
        //This batch compressor solves this problem over multiple frames.
        //The dedicated batch analysis has some pretty nice advantages:
        //0) Removes stay (relatively) fast- no O(n) searching or complex logic.
        //1) High churn adds/removes are extremely common during chaotic collisions, which is exactly when you need as little overhead as possible. 
        //1.5) High churn situations will tend to rapidly invalidate the 'optimization' effort of extremely aggressive on-remove swaps.
        //2) On-removal will often fail to make any change due to other reference blockages.
        //3) Dedicated batch analysis can be deferred over multiple frames because the intermediate results are all fine from a correctness standpoint. 
        //3.5) Deferred costs can be kept consistently low no matter what kind of add/remove churn is happening.
        //4) Dedicated batch analysis can be performed asynchronously and hidden behind other stally stages which aren't the solver and don't modify the solver (e.g. broadphase, midphase).
        //5) Even if we are in a 'suboptimal' constraint configuration (i.e. some pulldowns exist), it will rarely have an effect on performance unless it actually results in extra batches.
        //6) Dedicated analysis could afford to perform more complex heuristics to optimize batches. This doesn't do anything clever, but in theory, it could.

        //Note that this is trying to solve an NP hard problem (graph edge coloring) with a strictly greedy approach, so it won't produce optimal results.
        //(In fact, it could use almost twice as many batches as would be optimal!)
        //There's probably an argument to be made for a slightly more clever approach later on- consider that the BVH SAH optimization is NP hard too, but the 
        //broadphase's incremental refinement does pretty well (and quite a bit better than pure greedy approaches). It is likely we can create something 
        //similar here. Some possibilities:
        //1) Grab a random set of N constraints from each batch, speculatively remove all of them and 'rebatch' them with a more expensive local
        //optimizer. The rebatching would have to take into account all the other bodies represented in the batches at each level. There is no guarantee this
        //would make progress unless the 'rebatching' algorithm was provably better than greedy and you had a sufficiently large rebatching region.
        //2) Claim a region of the constraint graph by traversing it. Execute misra & gries or similar not-exponential offline operations on it.
        //3) Maybe claim a smaller region and use an optimal (exponential) algorithm. I suspect covering a large region would work better.
        //This would be similar to treelet rotations in BVH refinement.

        //(Keep in mind that the difference between an optimal coloring and the greedy coloring is pretty small as far as solve time goes.
        //Expect less than 5% impact. In other words, it's not worth spending a month on a research project when there's so many other options to pursue.)
