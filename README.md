lots of messy scribbles

The main object of interest in this repo right now is the prototype tree implementation under Trees/SingleArray. The application is currently configured to compare the performance of the old BEPUphysics broad phase with this tree.

There are also a few worse tree implementations and some SIMD solver fiddling.

No documentation for this repo. Useful stuff will eventually get promoted out into cleaner repos.
