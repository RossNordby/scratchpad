The main object of interest in this repo right now is the prototype tree implementation under SIMDPrototyping/Trees/SingleArray. The application is currently configured to compare the performance of the old BEPUphysics broad phase with this tree. For more information, see the blog post: http://www.bepuphysics.com/blog/2015/9/19/blazing-fast-trees.html

There are also a few worse tree implementations and some SIMD solver fiddling.

No documentation for this repo. Useful stuff will eventually get promoted out into cleaner repos.
