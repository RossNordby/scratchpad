# scratchpad

The two main objects of interest in this repo right now are:

1) The [prototype tree implementation](https://github.com/RossNordby/scratchpad/tree/master/SIMDPrototyping/SIMDPrototyping/Trees/SingleArray). The SIMDPrototyping application is currently configured to compare the performance of the old BEPUphysics broad phase with this tree. For more information, see the blog post: http://www.bepuphysics.com/blog/2015/9/19/blazing-fast-trees.html

2) [BEPUutilities v2](https://github.com/RossNordby/scratchpad/tree/master/BEPUutilities%20v2). It's slowly being adapted for use with System.Numerics.Vectors. Expect it to eventually house a better-packaged variant of the above tree.

There are also a few worse tree implementations and some SIMD solver fiddling.

No documentation for this repo. Useful stuff will eventually get promoted out into cleaner repos.
